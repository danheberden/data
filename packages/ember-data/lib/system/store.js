// Implementors Note:
//
//   The variables in this file are consistently named according to the following
//   scheme:
//
//   * +id+ means an identifier managed by an external source, provided inside
//     the data provided by that source. These are always coerced to be strings
//     before being used internally.
//   * +clientId+ means a transient numerical identifier generated at runtime by
//     the data store. It is important primarily because newly created objects may
//     not yet have an externally generated id.
//   * +reference+ means a record reference object, which holds metadata about a
//     record, even if it has not yet been fully materialized.
//   * +type+ means a subclass of DS.Model.

// Used by the store to normalize IDs entering the store.  Despite the fact
// that developers may provide IDs as numbers (e.g., `store.find(Person, 1)`),
// it is important that internally we use strings, since IDs may be serialized
// and lose type information.  For example, Ember's router may put a record's
// ID into the URL, and if we later try to deserialize that URL and find the
// corresponding record, we will not know if it is a string or a number.

/**
  The store contains all of the data for records loaded from the server.
  It is also responsible for creating instances of DS.Model that wrap
  the individual data for a record, so that they can be bound to in your
  Handlebars templates.

  Define your application's store like this:

       MyApp.Store = DS.Store.extend();

  Most Ember.js applications will only have a single `DS.Store` that is
  automatically created by their `Ember.Application`.

  You can retrieve models from the store in several ways. To retrieve a record
  for a specific id, use `DS.Model`'s `find()` method:

       var person = App.Person.find(123);

  If your application has multiple `DS.Store` instances (an unusual case), you can
  specify which store should be used:

      var person = store.find(App.Person, 123);

  In general, you should retrieve models using the methods on `DS.Model`; you should
  rarely need to interact with the store directly.

  By default, the store will talk to your backend using a standard REST mechanism.
  You can customize how the store talks to your backend by specifying a custom adapter:

       MyApp.store = DS.Store.create({
         adapter: 'MyApp.CustomAdapter'
       });

  You can learn more about writing a custom adapter by reading the `DS.Adapter`
  documentation.

  /**
    This is the main entry point into finding records. The first parameter to
    this method is always a subclass of `DS.Model`.

    You can use the `find` method on a subclass of `DS.Model` directly if your
    application only has one store. For example, instead of
    `store.find(App.Person, 1)`, you could say `App.Person.find(1)`.

    ---

    To find a record by ID, pass the `id` as the second parameter:

        store.find(App.Person, 1);
        App.Person.find(1);

    If the record with that `id` had not previously been loaded, the store will
    return an empty record immediately and ask the adapter to find the data by
    calling the adapter's `find` method.

    The `find` method will always return the same object for a given type and
    `id`. To check whether the adapter has populated a record, you can check
    its `isLoaded` property.

    ---

    To find all records for a type, call `find` with no additional parameters:

        store.find(App.Person);
        App.Person.find();

    This will return a `RecordArray` representing all known records for the
    given type and kick off a request to the adapter's `findAll` method to load
    any additional records for the type.

    The `RecordArray` returned by `find()` is live. If any more records for the
    type are added at a later time through any mechanism, it will automatically
    update to reflect the change.

    ---

    To find a record by a query, call `find` with a hash as the second
    parameter:

        store.find(App.Person, { page: 1 });
        App.Person.find({ page: 1 });

    This will return a `RecordArray` immediately, but it will always be an
    empty `RecordArray` at first. It will call the adapter's `findQuery`
    method, which will populate the `RecordArray` once the server has returned
    results.

    You can check whether a query results `RecordArray` has loaded by checking
    its `isLoaded` property.
